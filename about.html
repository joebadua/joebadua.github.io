            <h1> What do I do? </h1>
            <p id="about-p">I'm currently working at Apple as a Software Engineer under the Apple Services Engineering org. I've been at Apple for ~5 years and it's been great.</p>
      
            <h1> About Me </h1>
            <p id="about-p">I graduated December 2019 from CSU East Bay with my B.S in Computer Science. Afterwards, I interned as a Software Engineer at <a id="underline" href="https://freewiretech.com">FreeWire</a> in San Leandro. Immediately after this internship, I started at Apple.</p>
            <p id= about-p>Outside of work, I play tennis and hangout with friends. For the most part however, I love staying at home and relaxing. I'm into movies (I write some serious/unserious reviews on <a id="underline" href="https://letterboxd.com/joebadua/">letterboxd</a>!)"</p>
            <p id= about-p>I'm also a self-proclaimed "hip-hop head". I love keeping up to date with latest music releases. (and I track all of my music stats on <a id="underline" href="https://www.last.fm/user/audabeoj">last.fm</a>).</p>
            <p id= about-p>I also enjoy hanging out with my cat <a id="underline" href="https://instagram.com/kidalphonse">cat Alphonse</a>. My favorite thing to do with him is take silly photos.</p>
