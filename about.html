            <h1> About Me </h1>
            <p id="about-p">I am a Software Engineer in Test at Apple, stationed at Infinite Loop. I signed an NDA so I can&#39;t really speak much about what I do, but I&#39;m a part of the Apple Media Products Team covering Apple Music, Apple TV+, iTunes, the App Store... almost anything along that line.</p>
            <p id="about-p">I recently graduated this past December from CSU East Bay with my B.S in Computer Science. Afterwards, I interned as a Software Engineer at <a id="underline" href="https://freewiretech.com">FreeWire</a> in San Leandro. </p>
            <p id= about-p>Hobbies include tennis, music, video games, and film photography. Right now, my video game queue includes Final Fantasy 7, Animal Crossing, and Super Smash Bro&#39;s. Also, I have an <a id="underline" href="https://instagram.com/joeucsf">Instagram</a> account where I post my 35mm shots, and my recent listens are tracked on <a id="underline" href="https://last.fm/user/sh4dowjoez">Last.FM</a>. Please feel free to follow me on these platforms!</p>
            <p id="about-p">... and that&#39;s it. I&#39;m not really sure what else to put here. But thanks for reading!  （*＾ワ＾*）</p>
